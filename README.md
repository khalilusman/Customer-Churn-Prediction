# Customer-Churn-Prediction
 This project implements a Customer Churn Prediction model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with 26 input features and hidden layers employing ReLU and LeakyReLU activations. The model uses the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss, with one-hot encoding for categorical variables. It aims to effectively predict customer churn
